Design, build, review, and publish GitHub Skills-style exercises with custom agents and Agent Skills for learner journeys, workflow-backed validation, and release readiness.

## What's Included

### Agents

| Agent | Mention | Role | Tool Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Outline Architect** | `@github-skills-outline-architect` | Converts an idea, workshop, or demo into a learner-centered exercise outline with objectives, scenario, steps, validation, and success criteria. | Read, search, fetch, and edit planning docs |
| **Exercise Builder** | `@github-skills-exercise-builder` | Converts an approved outline into repository structure, Markdown steps, issue flow, workflows, and validation scaffolding. | Full coding and test tools |
| **Quality Reviewer** | `@github-skills-quality-reviewer` | Reviews an exercise for learning value, validation reliability, workflow safety, accessibility, and publish readiness. | Read, search, run commands, and run tests |
| **Publisher** | `@github-skills-publisher` | Prepares release notes, PR descriptions, validation evidence, final checklist, and publication handoff guidance. | Read, edit docs, run commands, and run tests |

### Skills

The plugin provides four lifecycle skills:

- `/create-github-skills-outline` — design a new exercise or convert training material into a self-paced GitHub Skills outline.
- `/bootstrap-github-skills-exercise` — create repository files, step Markdown, workflow plans, validation scripts, and starter structure from an approved outline.
- `/review-github-skills-exercise` — audit an exercise for learner experience, validation correctness, workflow safety, accessibility, and readiness.
- `/publish-github-skills-exercise` — prepare final checklist, release notes, PR copy, validation evidence, and launch guidance.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the exercise outline

```
@github-skills-outline-architect I want to teach [topic] as a 30-minute GitHub Skills exercise.
Use /create-github-skills-outline to define objectives, learner steps, and validation ideas.
```

### 2. Bootstrap the repository

```
@github-skills-exercise-builder Use the approved outline to scaffold the exercise.
Use /bootstrap-github-skills-exercise to create README content, steps, workflows, and validation guidance.
```

### 3. Review before launch

```
@github-skills-quality-reviewer Review this exercise for learner clarity, validation reliability, workflow safety, and accessibility.
Use /review-github-skills-exercise and prioritize release blockers.
```

### 4. Prepare for publication

```
@github-skills-publisher Prepare this exercise for release.
Use /publish-github-skills-exercise to produce validation evidence, PR description, release notes, and remaining risks.
```

## How It Works

The plugin splits exercise creation into four focused phases so the human can approve the learning design before repository automation is generated:

- **Outline first** — define the learner outcome, scenario, steps, and validation signals.
- **Bootstrap second** — create or update repository assets only after the outline is approved.
- **Review third** — catch weak validation, unsafe workflow behavior, unclear learner instructions, and accessibility issues.
- **Publish last** — assemble release evidence and handoff notes for contribution or rollout.

## Companion Instructions

The Awesome Copilot plugin spec declares plugin content with `agents`, `commands`, and `skills`. Copilot instructions are standalone resources, so this plugin includes `instructions/github-skills-exercises.instructions.md` as an optional companion file to copy into exercise repositories.

## Evaluation

Test prompts are in `evals/evals.json`. They cover outline creation, bootstrap planning, quality review, and publish readiness.
